description=
description=The Heavy Expanded Mobility Tactical Truck (HEMTT) is an eight-wheel drive, diesel-powered, 10-short-ton (9,100 kg) tactical truck.[2] The M977 HEMTT first entered service in 1982 with the United States Army as a replacement for the M520 Goer.
description=The HEMTT's objective is to provide heavy transport capabilities for supply and re-supply of combat vehicles and weapons systems. Compared to earlier generation 5-ton trucks in U.S. Army service it offers increased payload and mobility. The HEMTT is available in a variety of configurations, including cargo, tanker, tractor.

description=[h3]Note: The vehicles have static center wheels due to PZ limitations only correctable by the developers. They will remain so until they add official support for more wheels (more than 4) as it is currently impossible without "pseudo wheels) that add no physics support.[/h3]
